## Introduction 
This is a simple, sophisticated, reusable and changeable interface for a login and registration portal/system.

## Why this project:question:
Sometimes when creating applications(mobile or pc), we usually need to collect our user's personal information, especially during the creation of accounts.
 
For this reason, this simple but sophisticated portal/system was created to help ease User Information Collection. 

## Why use this:question:
Perhaps you've seen many others out there, and asked yourself seeing this one: Why should I use this one precisely? Let me outline some reasons:

* Comments: There are comments everywhere to help you understand the project easily;
* Password-Security: password strength measures where implemented(length, characters, digits). You could add others or reduce already existing ones depending on your project;
* Storage: Information collected could be easily sent over to a database for better storage;
* Active Development: This project is under active development and more features are on their way...(check the RoadMap)


## Requirements :heavy_check_mark:
* [python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/)
* pip
* [kivy 2.1.0](https://github.com/kivy/kivy) (currently master branch)
* [kivyMD 1.0.2](https://github.com/kivymd/KivyMD) (currently master branch)
* [sweetalert](https://github.com/kivymd-extensions/sweetalert)

Note: To install all at once, a `requirements.txt` file is present in the main directory. You could use the following command in your virtual environment:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



## Installation :memo:
